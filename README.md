### Source texts ###
The source text used as the starting point for this project was obtained on 2018-12-18 from the website of [MadaBibliq](https://web.archive.org/web/20181218163116/http://madabibliq.org:80/) that subsequently went AWOL.

*The original URL is now occupied by a domain squatter, so the above link is to an archived copy on the **Wayback Machine**.*

The sister website **Madagascar pour Christ** now redirects to [Henoy Ny Baiboly](https://nybaiboly.net/).

This page has the [Malagasy Bible](https://nybaiboly.net/Bible.htm) available in both **.htm** and **.doc** format, just as the earlier website did.

NB. *I have not yet checked whether any editing changes were made after December 2018.*

It is not known how accurately transcribed the above digitised text source is relative to the corresponding printed edition of the Malagasy Bible.

A scanned library copy of the **1887 Edition** of the Malagasy Bible with 1656 pages has been found [here](https://archive.org/details/nysoratramasinad00lond).

This is entitled **Ny Soratra Masina, dia ny Testamenta Taloha sy ny Testamenta Vaovao; Nadika avy tamy ny teny Hebreo sy Grika. (Revision Committee's Version, 1887)**.

This was published in 1889 by the [British and Foreign Bible Society](https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/), is held by the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), and scanned in 2014. AFAICT, this has not been converted to a usable electronic text.
