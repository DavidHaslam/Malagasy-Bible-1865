## Français ##
La première Bible malgache a été éditée en 1835, traduite par le missionnaire gallois David Griffiths (1792-1863) de la [Société missionnaire de Londres](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_missionnaire_de_Londres). Elle a subi sa toute première correction entre 1865 et 1866.

## English ##
The first Malagasy Bible was published in 1835, translated by Welsh missionary David Griffiths (1792-1863) of the [London Missionary Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Missionary_Society). It underwent its first revision between 1865 and 1866.

### Source texts ###
The source text used as the starting point for this project was obtained on 2018-12-18 from the website of [MadaBibliq](https://web.archive.org/web/20181218163116/http://madabibliq.org:80/) that subsequently went AWOL.

*The original URL is now occupied by a domain squatter, so the above link is to an archived copy on the **Wayback Machine**.*

One of the downloads on the **Concordance** page is particularly useful by being in [Zefania](https://www.zefaniabible.com/) like XML format, which can be downloaded from the following [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20181122034615/http://madabibliq.org/Concordance-malagasy/Linux_Bibliquest_Concordance_Malgache-2.1.0.tar.bz2) as a file in .tar.bz2 Linux compressed format. This contains an XML file called **malgache_malgache.xml** dated 2011-07-27 that was designed for use with [Bibliquest](https://www.bibliquest.net/) Bible software.

The sister website **Madagascar pour Christ** now redirects to [Henoy Ny Baiboly](https://nybaiboly.net/).

This page has the [Malagasy Bible](https://nybaiboly.net/Bible.htm) available in both **.htm** and **.doc** format, just as the earlier website did.

NB. *I have not yet checked whether any editing changes were made after December 2018.*

It is not known how accurately transcribed the above digitised text source is relative to the corresponding printed edition of the Malagasy Bible.

### Reference work ###

A scanned library copy of the **1887 Edition** of the Malagasy Bible with 1656 pages has been found [here](https://archive.org/details/nysoratramasinad00lond).

This is entitled **Ny Soratra Masina, dia ny Testamenta Taloha sy ny Testamenta Vaovao; Nadika avy tamy ny teny Hebreo sy Grika. (Revision Committee's Version, 1887)**.

This was published in 1889 by the [British and Foreign Bible Society](https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/), is held by the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), and scanned in 2014. AFAICT, this has not been converted to a usable electronic text. Nevertheless, this may be useful as a reference work to resolve issues with the digitised source text.

### License ###
The Malagasy Bible (1865) is Public Domain.

### Project aims ###
The main aim of this project is to derive an input file in **OSIS** XML format suitable for making a SWORD module for use with Bible study front-end apps associated with the [CrossWire Bible Society](https://crosswire.org/).

#### Text development ####
I did a significant amount of detailed text development during December 2018. 

Many of the details are recorded in my email conversations with this [developer](https://github.com/refdoc).

#### Versification ####
So far, the best fit versification for SWORD is **German** even though the Malagasy Bible was also published as a parallel text edition with a French Bible.

See [La BIBLE Franco-Malgache](https://web.archive.org/web/20181206105212fw_/http://www.madabibliq.org/Bible_franco-malgache/Bible_table_matieres.htm) **En colonnes parallèles côte à côte, la Bible en français (traduction J.N. Darby) et la Bible Malgache.** 

##### Psalm titles #####
The canonical Psalm titles were incorrectly versified in the source XML file. It was necessary to reversify these as verse 1 (sometimes 1-2) and renumber the subsequent verses in such Psalms.

#### Project status ####
Source files and derived files are yet to be uploaded.
